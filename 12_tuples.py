# This is a tuple
t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
# here we print this tuple
print(t)

# since we know that tuple is immutable or in other words it cannot be changed
# we can see here that if we try to change it
t[1] = 2
print(t)

#it throws an error that - 'tuple' object does not support item assignment... 
# so ther conclusion is that we cannot change tuple
